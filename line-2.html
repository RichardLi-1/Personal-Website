            The TTC has recently issued a Request for Proposal for 330 new train cars, or 55 new trains, to replace the 3 decade old T1 subway cars currently running on Line 2.

            <br><br>In the grand scheme of things, 3 decades is not long for a subway car. The T1’s predecessors: the H5 and H6, were built for up to 50 years of life. Refurbishments could undoubtedly keep the T1s in revenue service, but with studies showing that a new fleet is likely the more cost-effective option, it may be worth redefining what we consider a standard subway car in Toronto, so that we don’t order a near carbon copy of the Toronto Rocket fleet.

            <br><br>Unlike previous orders, where Line 1—the curvier, more physically demanding line—was prioritized for new fleets, this new fleet will undoubtedly prioritize Line 2, as they are specially designed to fit Greenwood Yard. This presents certain opportunities that I believe we should absolutely capitalize on.

            <h1 class="accent common-font">Faster acceleration and deceleration</h1>

            <p class="blog-text">
            On a line like Line 2, where stop spacing is very dense throughout the line, acceleration speeds trump max speeds in net travel times.

            <br><br>My personal complaint for the current Toronto Subway cars is how slow the acceleration and deceleration is. The TTC has historically been against running subways at full speeds, historically with the mandate of running at “low rate,” and recently with the stunting of acceleration speeds by CBTC (Automatic Train Control).

            <br><br>Rolling stock in New York City has acceleration speeds of about 1.1 m/s2, helping local lines with close stop spacing still feel fast, compared to the T1’s measly 0.85m/s2. The Toronto Rocket received a small bump to 0.9m/s2, but we could go further. Faster acceleration and deceleration means more TPH for the same number of trains, and taking more advantage of closer gaps with CBTC. Even if the TTC continues prioritizing power usage and propulsion durability over acceleration speeds, any added acceleration capability would be useful during rush hours, when capacity is paramount. We would have to wait until the full retirement of T1s to prevent acceleration inconsistencies, but the same goes for CBTC. Line 2 has limited room for capacity expansion as is, but running faster trains is one of them.

            <!--<br><br>**Total capacity increase by way of increased acceleration:** -->

        </p>
            
        <h1 class="accent common-font">Shorter train cars, longer trains</h1>

        <p class="blog-text">

            Another way to increase capacity is to take advantage of our station lengths.

            <br><br>Currently, trains have a few meters of extra room on platforms. This was useful during times of manual operation, where it was necessary to have a margin of error. But with the onset of CBTC (or ATC) on Line 2, which these trains are being ordered for, the margin of error is no longer necessary. 

            <br><br>There isn’t room to add a full extra car, extra length could be added with two methods:

            <br><br>1. Shortening the overall length of cars on trains and running an extra car. We could order 7 car, ~66 feet long trains, which would make use of the extra space.
            <br><br>2. Running an intermediate “C” car shorter than other cars to fill the extra space, which would not cause a capacity deficiency with the new fleet's open gangways.

            <br><br>Both are no doubt logistically challenging, whether it be changes to maintenance structures or storage, but I would like the TTC to consider them as possibilities as CBTC is rolled out and demand increases.

            <br><br>“Well, what about when CBTC is not fully installed, and the trains must run in manual operation?” Two options: extra care in deceleration on the part of operators or adding 7th cars after the full rollout.

            <br><br>This is something which, if ever considered, should be considered now, before future projects like platform screen doors are installed. Yet I suspect that the TTC will continue with its current train car length—if not due to logistics, then due to philosophy.

            <!--<br><br>**Total capacity increase by way of lengthened trains:** 

            <br><br>In total, these improvements could result in a Line 2 capacity increase of -->

            <br><br>There are a few, less quantitative improvements that could be made as well.

        <h1 class="accent common-font">Less Tinted Windows</h1>

        <p class="blog-text">

            This one is mainly a personal opinion. I would prefer to see outside during my train ride, so I would prefer for the new fleet’s windows to be less tinted than the Toronto Rocket’s.

        <h1 class="accent common-font">Character</h1>

        <p class="blog-text">

            Design is undoubtedly a major consideration in transit projects. Design and architecture plays a major role in how we feel and perceive in various places, and this holds true for subways.

            <br><br>Compared to previous subway cars, like the H5s and H6s with their unique accent coloured doors and beige panels, the TRs and even the T1s are much more industrial and devoid of colour. I would ascribe the design of the Toronto Rocket’s interior more to a hospital, not a subway car. The new fleet has been rendered with more red livery in the fronts and sides of trains. Why not bring that to more of the train, like the interior as well?

            <br><br>There are other changes likely to occur to the new fleet, including a less slanted front, larger door windows, and better front signage—all changes that will improve the end user experience.

            <br><br>As Line 2 grows and is extended deep into Scarborough <a href="future.html">(separate article on that topic)</a>, its usage and importance will grow with it. Planning our improvements strategically will allow Toronto’s most important east-west transit artery to thrive well into the next century.
